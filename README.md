Chrome Extension for Tabs Storage

In Chrome I organise sites by tabs: "admin", "Coding" and "Uni" for each of the three areas of my life.
For many, they require re-login and authentication if I close and reopen, so I'm in the habit of having them all loaded constantly and opening the tab folders when needed and work inside of that.
Problem is, my macs getting old, and Chrome using up 20Gb in the background, isn't great.

So here's my extension that stores my sites in the three areas I like, and still super easy to load and reach, without having to search and navigate.
But saving storage and RAM :)
